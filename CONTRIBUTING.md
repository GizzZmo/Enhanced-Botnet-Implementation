## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Basic understanding of cybersecurity concepts
- Familiarity with async/await programming

### Fork and Clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Enhanced-Botnet-Implementation.git
   cd Enhanced-Botnet-Implementation
   ```

3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/GizzZmo/Enhanced-Botnet-Implementation.git
   ```

## üîß Development Setup

### Environment Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install pytest pytest-asyncio black flake8 bandit mypy
   ```

3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   python -c "import utils; print('‚úÖ Setup successful')"
   ```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file for local development (never commit this file):
```bash
BOTNET_HOST=127.0.0.1
BOTNET_PORT=9999
BOTNET_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
BOTNET_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_test_password
```

## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We follow PEP 8 with some modifications:

- **Line length**: Maximum 127 characters
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports, group by standard library, third-party, local
- **Naming**: 
  - Functions and variables: `snake_case`
  - Classes: `PascalCase`
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
  - Private members: prefix with `_`

### Type Hints

All new code must include type hints:

```python
from typing import Optional, Dict, List, Any

def process_command(command: str, bot_id: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Process a command with proper type hints."""
    pass
```

### Docstrings

Use Google-style docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules:

```python
def encrypt_data(data: bytes, key: Optional[bytes] = None) -> bytes:
    """
    Encrypt data using AES-256-CBC encryption.
    
    Args:
        data: Raw data to encrypt
        key: Optional encryption key (generates new if None)
    
    Returns:
        Encrypted data with IV prepended
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If data is invalid
        
    Example:
        >>> encrypted = encrypt_data(b"secret message")
        >>> assert len(encrypted) > len(b"secret message")
    """
    pass
```

### Code Formatting

Use Black for code formatting:
```bash
black .
```

Use flake8 for linting:
```bash
flake8 . --max-line-length=127
```

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- All new code must include tests
- Aim for >90% test coverage
- Include both unit and integration tests
- Test edge cases and error conditions

### Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/classes
   ```python
   def test_encryption_functionality():
       encryption = SecureEncryption()
       data = b"test data"
       encrypted = encryption.encrypt(data)
       decrypted = encryption.decrypt(encrypted)
       assert decrypted == data
   ```

2. **Security Tests**: Validate security features
   ```python
   def test_input_sanitization():
       validator = InputValidator()
       malicious_input = "command\x00\x01\x02"
       sanitized = validator.sanitize_command(malicious_input)
       assert '\x00' not in sanitized
   ```

3. **Performance Tests**: Ensure performance requirements
   ```python
   def test_encryption_performance():
       encryption = SecureEncryption()
       start_time = time.time()
       for _ in range(1000):
           encryption.encrypt(b"test")
       assert time.time() - start_time < 1.0
   ```

4. **Async Tests**: Test async functionality
   ```python
   async def test_async_bot_tracking():
       tracker = BotTracker()
       await tracker.add_bot("test_bot", "127.0.0.1")
       assert tracker.get_bot_count() == 1
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/test_security.py
pytest tests/test_performance.py

# Run async tests
pytest tests/test_botnet_controller.py::TestBotnetControllerAsync
```

## üîí Security Guidelines

### Security Requirements

1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: Use environment variables or config files
2. **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs
3. **Secure Encryption**: Use AES-256 minimum, no XOR encryption
4. **Logging Safety**: Never log sensitive data
5. **Error Handling**: Don't expose sensitive information in errors

### Security Checklist

Before submitting code, verify:
