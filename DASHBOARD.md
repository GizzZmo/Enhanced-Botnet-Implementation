## API Endpoints

The dashboard uses REST API endpoints for data:

- `GET /` - Serves the dashboard HTML
- `GET /api/status` - Server status and statistics
- `GET /api/bots` - Active bot information
- `GET /api/stats` - Detailed performance metrics

## Technical Details

### Matrix Rain Effect
- Canvas-based animation using falling characters
- Customizable character set and speed
- Transparent overlay that doesn't interfere with UI
- Automatically resizes with browser window

### Real-time Updates
- JavaScript fetches data every 2 seconds
- Graceful fallback to demo data if server unavailable
- Smooth animations for changing values
- Progress bars update in real-time

### Security
- All existing security features maintained
- API endpoints use same validation as main server
- No sensitive data exposed in web interface
- Sanitized logging and display

## Development

The dashboard consists of:

- `dashboard.html` - Complete HTML template with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- `botnet_server_enhanced.py` - Enhanced server with web endpoints
- `utils.py` - Updated configuration for web server settings

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Chromium (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

Note: The matrix effect uses HTML5 Canvas and may perform better in modern browsers.

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard Not Loading
1. Verify server is running: `netstat -an | grep 8080`
2. Check firewall settings for port 8080
3. Review server logs for errors

### No Data Updates
1. Ensure main server is running on port 9999
2. Check network connectivity between dashboard and API
3. Review browser console for JavaScript errors

### Matrix Effect Not Working
1. Ensure JavaScript is enabled in browser
2. Check browser console for Canvas errors
3. Try refreshing the page
